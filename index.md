Currently, I am looking for entry- to mid-level employment opportunities in research and project management, particularly in the cultural and planning sectors. You can read more about me [here](/about.md) and see some of my mapping, design, and writing work [here](work.md). I also welcome inquiries for artistic or academic collaboration, so please feel free to reach out at pwojcik606 {at} gmail {dot} com.
